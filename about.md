<p>I am Master's student at University of Montreal and MILA. I'm interested in creating systems that generalize well and can be interpreted, much like humans.
<br>
I worked on an open-source project on scaling time series transformer models. Recently, I interned at Hydro-Quebec where I worked on uncertainty estimation of virtual sensor measurements if a sensor fails before end of commissioning using Deep Kernel methods.  
<br>
Previously, I worked at Ecolab as part of Advanced data analytics team. I worked on projects requiring proof of concept using predictive analytics such as Pump efficiency prediction, Analysing paint defects for automotive customers and Wearable analytics.
<br>
I have Bachelor of Technology in Information and Communication Technology from Ahmedabad University.
In my free time I enjoy playing Violin!
