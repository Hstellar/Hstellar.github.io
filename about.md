I am Master's student at University of Montreal and MILA. I am interested in building systems that generalize well like humans do and are interpretable.

Previously, I worked at [Ecolab](https://en-ca.ecolab.com/) as part of Advanced data analytics team. I worked on projects requiring proof of concept using predictive analytics such as Pump efficiency prediction, Analysing paint defects for automotive customers and Wearable analytics.

I have Bachelor of Technology in Information and Communication Technology from Ahmedabad University.
