<p>I am Master's student at University of Montreal and MILA. I am interested in building systems that generalize well like humans do and are interpretable.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I worked at Ecolab as part of Advanced data analytics team. I worked on projects requiring proof of concept using predictive analytics such as Pump efficiency prediction, Analysing paint defects for automotive customers and Wearable analytics.
<br><br>
I have Bachelor of Technology in Information and Communication Technology from Ahmedabad University.
