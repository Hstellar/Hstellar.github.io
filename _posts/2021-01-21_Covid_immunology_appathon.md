To effectively combat the widespread transmission of COVID-19 infection and save lives especially of those vulnerable individuals, it is imperative to better understand its pathophysiology to enable effective diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies using rapidly shared data.

Immunology: There are two types of immune responses: innate and adaptive.
* The innate response is the body’s first reaction (non-specific) to a foreign invader (e.g., a laceration), consisting of physical barriers like skin and mucus membranes and immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes that migrate to the injury site to kill the invader.
* The adaptive response is highly specific involving a response upon recognition of an antigen, a molecule presented on the surface of a foreign invader from an infection (not self). Major components of the adaptive response include T cells, B cells, immunoglobulins (antibodies), and the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC), group of genes that code for proteins found on the surfaces of cells that help the immune system recognize foreign invaders is also called HLA system in humans.
* T cell receptors (TCRs) are protein complexes on the surface of T cells responsible for recognizing antigens bound to MHC molecules. Similarly, B cell receptors (BCRs) are protein complexes on the surface of B cells. Upon interaction between BCRs and their cognate antigens to activate B cells, B cells proliferate and differentiate to generate a population of antibody-secreting plasma B cells and memory B cells. Thus, understanding an individual’s diverse TCR and BCR repertoires, as well as HLA type (antigen presenting) and immunoglobin H (IgH antibody) states, is important in accelerating COVID-19 research.

We perform Exploratory data analysis v_call(variability), d_call(diversity), j_call(joining_segment) which are connected with repertoires, demographic features(such as intervention, ethnicity, medical history) and variable indicating covid severity.
